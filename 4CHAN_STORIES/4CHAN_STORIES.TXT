> be me in early 20s
> working graveyard as a security guard at spooky old hospital
> hospital being renovated to be rented to teach company
> walking rounds about 3 am after construction workers and maintenace/janitors leave
> walking up a set up stairs, hear voice say "someone is watching you"
> look around, reply "no, no one is watching me"
> five minutes later realize I replied out loud to something I heard, even though I was only one in building


> the bottom few floors were still owned by the hospital, and the janitors cleaned up until about 2 am
> there was a ghost of a woman in a white dress who wandered the ground floor and the tenth floor
> construction workers would not go on the 10th floor after dark
> sometimes janitors quit in the middle of a shift, walked out and never came back
> after tech company moved in, their security guards would sometimes quit in the middle of a graveyard shift, just walk out and call the main office
> next day to quit

> there was a rivalry between the security guard companies
> the company I worked for worked for property management, other one worked for the tech company
> we patrolled the parking lot and the office buildings
> when hospital was built there were houses for some of the doctors, those were turned into office spaces
> I had check them after the janitors left
> if a door was unlocked I had to walk through the buillding
> the office buildings had attic trapdoors with deadbolts
> whenever I walked beneath one it would shake
> like something in the attic was trying to open the trapdoor
> eventually I stopped checking those buildings if a door was unlocked
