Put 60 batshit crazy ideas here.
Then once you get to 60, do a stream.

1. Get capture deer. Give it some meth. And then shoot it in
   self defense. We can put the footage on youtube as well
   for some views.
   
2. Get some drones and use them to go duck hunting.
   Instead of "dash ducks" we will call it "duck destroyer".
   
3. To collect berries high up in trees. Get a vinyl tube
   from hardware store and attach to broom. Poke broom
   up in tree and suck on one end of the tube to grab
   unreachable berries.
   
   (Sugarplums)
   
4. Why I think I will avoid DMT.
   DMT supposdily makes you hallucinate.
   And I hear the chemical is released when you are dying.
   So... If you've never taken DMT and you are dying you'll
   be all like "Oh thank god, there actually is an afterlife."
   If you take DMT and you start dying, you are going to 
   be all like "Fuck, I am on a DMT acid trip. There is no"
   "god, and I am dying."
   
5. Idea to get our dinosaurs back.
   Step1 : Get some chickens.
   Step2 : Burn fossil fuels so we can undo the disasterous
           effects of global cooling caused by all the plants.
   Step3 : Wait a few million years.
   Grandma: But then you will have only one kind of dinosaur.
   Me:      We can get some turkeys too.
   
6. Another deer idea: Deer hunger games.
   We capture bucks. And put live streaming go pros on them.
   Then we live stream to youtube all hunting season.
   It will be like fantasy football. But everyone bets on
   which buck is the last one standing.
   
   We can also have a "fringe bet" called "Hunter mauled to"
   "death by buck."
   
7. People have an aversion to things that look almost human,
   but are not. It is called the "uncanny valley". Makes you
   wonder... What kind of creature existed long ago that
   would make humans evolve to have such a fear?
   Creepy right? Definitely proof that supernatural monsters
   exist...
   
   No you idiot. We are the monsters. We killed the neanderthals.
   You know, those things that kinda look like humans except
   they have bigger brains? Oh. But if they are so smart,
   why are they dead? Because, while we are less intelligent,
   we are more violent.
   
8. Bigfoot is a redneck democrat. If we are to believe the media
   and that republicans don't social distance. Bigfoot also
   walks around naking, making him a sexual offender. In fact,
   all animals do. Keep your children away from all animals,
   except for tiny dogs in cute outfits.
   
9. Tiny aggressive dogs should be outlawed. Or...
   Instead of sacrificing american lives to catch terrorist,
   we air drop 100 angry dogs. Maybe chiwawas or something.
   They will storm the compounds. Maybe give them tiny
   vests.
   
10. You know how some criminals will have children run drugs
   for them because if the kids get caught with drugs they
   wont go to jail because they are minors? I have an idea
   like this, lets train racoons to rob banks.
   
11. Totally Not illegal package .com.
    You order something on totally not illegal package dot com.
    For example, maybe "mystery package that is definitely"
    "not LSD". Then the mystery package is burried in the woods.
    You are given GPS coordinates to get the package.
    You don't have to worry about someone stealing the 
    package off your front porch. And you can get the package
    whenever you want. This means someone like the 
    female body inspecters cant steak out the delivery
    location.
    
12. We have a weighted bird feeder that keeps squirrels away.
    They weight too much and it triggers a gate to shut so
    they can't get at the bird seed.
    
    Thought... It also works as a diet mechanism for birds.
    Bird gets too fat? Sorry bro, bird feeder closed.
    Come back when you lose some weight.
    
13. Get rich quick idea: Let's re-write parts of the bible
    to include god's P.O. box. Except the address is our
    address. And we take the money. If we get caught we just
    say that we are doing gods work. And that god isn't here
    right now but he'll be back for the rapture later.
    
14. Once we have genetic engineering, we will engineer people
    to be smart. Of coarse. But genetic engineering might
    require that we can't alter human fetuses. So to get
    around that we start off with like... A fox and inject
    human DNA into it. From there we will genetically
    engineer the smartest humans ever. And then we can
    start complaining about how "The furries are taking our jobs".
    
15. Of course we want our children to be smart and disease
    resistant. So we will genetically engineer that into them.
    Personally I wish my fetus was injected with glow in the
    dark ink so I could be like one of those glow in the dark
    rabbits. But there is another thing that is obviously 
    going to happen I don't hear anyone talk about...
    
    How long do you want your son's penis to be?
    
    What size do you want your daughter's breasts to be?
    
    We joke about "I was born without my consent."
    But when you think about things like this....
    I don't know. Maybe that joke isn't really a joke.
    
    I was born without my consent and intentionally
    given a tiny dick, and now I am angry and suing
    my parents.
    
    Or maybe your parents are really freaky. They
    intentionally give you two dicks. Or maybe three
    breasts. Have you seen hentai? The options are endless.
    
16. I know where ghosts come from.... Carbon monoxide poison.
    Aunt barb always thought the upstairs was haunted.
    Why? Well there is a wood stove downstairs and incomplete
    combustion creates carbon monoxide. The hot gasses would
    then travel upstairs because hot air rises.
    
    Grandma Says: But isn't all the gas in the chimey?
    
    Me: Chimney is even more haunted. Have you heard of
    santa clause?
    
17. Another money making idea.... The "REAL" ghost busters.
    We form a 2-person team. An HVAC guy and a psychologist.
    We go to paranomal convention. You tell me you have
    ghosts? We will get rid of those ghosts. First we have
    to figure out if you have a carbon monoxide gas leak
    or skitzophrenia.
    
18. Why are all the photos of big foot blurry?
    Obviously because big foot isn't a self-absorbed 
    millenial. Or maybe a zoomer? Do they follow that trend?
    
19. How do I know big foot is a guy? Well obviously they
    come in male and female varieties. Otherwise they
    wouldn't be able to reproduce. But "medium foot"
    doesn't quite have the same ring to it.    
    
20. What is the difference between 9-11 and a cow?
    You stop milking the cow after 10 years.
    That is an example of "faux edgyness".
    If you are offending old conservative people, you
    aren't edgy, you are just part of the status quo.
    Still a funny joke though. 
    
21. I hear "no one wants to work". No... No one wants to work
    a shitty fast food job. I am thinking about going onto
    the corner. You know. The corner. By the side of the
    highway entrance ramp where people beg?
    
    I am thinking about going there and printing off a big
    sign that says: "No one wants to work." and then
    I'll have another sign. "Will code for 5/hour."
    I have my own corporation. And thus can do contract
    work for under minimum wage legally. Think I'll have
    any takers? Probably not. Because like I said,
    people want to work. There is no worker shortage.
    Just a good job shortage.
    
    I should record that with a go pro. And hope I don't
    get arrested.
    
22. 
    The Dunes Resort, Gay Saugatuck Douglas
    
    Maybe god is actually an interior designer and
    the garden of eden is pretty fabulous?
