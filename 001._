Put 60 batshit crazy ideas here.
Then once you get to 60, do a stream.

1. Get capture deer. Give it some meth. And then shoot it in
   self defense. We can put the footage on youtube as well
   for some views.
   
2. Get some drones and use them to go duck hunting.
   Instead of "dash ducks" we will call it "duck destroyer".
   
3. To collect berries high up in trees. Get a vinyl tube
   from hardware store and attach to broom. Poke broom
   up in tree and suck on one end of the tube to grab
   unreachable berries.
   
   (Sugarplums)
   
4. Why I think I will avoid DMT.
   DMT supposdily makes you hallucinate.
   And I hear the chemical is released when you are dying.
   So... If you've never taken DMT and you are dying you'll
   be all like "Oh thank god, there actually is an afterlife."
   If you take DMT and you start dying, you are going to 
   be all like "Fuck, I am on a DMT acid trip. There is no"
   "god, and I am dying."
   
5. Idea to get our dinosaurs back.
   Step1 : Get some chickens.
   Step2 : Burn fossil fuels so we can undo the disasterous
           effects of global cooling caused by all the plants.
   Step3 : Wait a few million years.
   Grandma: But then you will have only one kind of dinosaur.
   Me:      We can get some turkeys too.
   
6. Another deer idea: Deer hunger games.
   We capture bucks. And put live streaming go pros on them.
   Then we live stream to youtube all hunting season.
   It will be like fantasy football. But everyone bets on
   which buck is the last one standing.
   
   We can also have a "fringe bet" called "Hunter mauled to"
   "death by buck."
   
    Idea: Deer hunger games. (Or I guess Buck hunger games)
    Step1: Knock some Bucks out with sedative darts.
    Step2: Attach live streaming Go-Pros to their antlers.
    Step3: People take bets as to which one will live the 
           longest during hunting season.
    Step4: Profit
    Step5: Get banned from Twitch.TV
   
7. People have an aversion to things that look almost human,
   but are not. It is called the "uncanny valley". Makes you
   wonder... What kind of creature existed long ago that
   would make humans evolve to have such a fear?
   Creepy right? Definitely proof that supernatural monsters
   exist...
   
   No you idiot. We are the monsters. We killed the neanderthals.
   You know, those things that kinda look like humans except
   they have bigger brains? Oh. But if they are so smart,
   why are they dead? Because, while we are less intelligent,
   we are more violent.
   
8. Bigfoot is a redneck democrat. If we are to believe the media
   and that republicans don't social distance. Bigfoot also
   walks around naking, making him a sexual offender. In fact,
   all animals do. Keep your children away from all animals,
   except for tiny dogs in cute outfits.
   
9. Tiny aggressive dogs should be outlawed. Or...
   Instead of sacrificing american lives to catch terrorist,
   we air drop 100 angry dogs. Maybe chiwawas or something.
   They will storm the compounds. Maybe give them tiny
   vests.
   
10. You know how some criminals will have children run drugs
   for them because if the kids get caught with drugs they
   wont go to jail because they are minors? I have an idea
   like this, lets train racoons to rob banks.
   
11. Totally Not illegal package .com.
    You order something on totally not illegal package dot com.
    For example, maybe "mystery package that is definitely"
    "not LSD". Then the mystery package is burried in the woods.
    You are given GPS coordinates to get the package.
    You don't have to worry about someone stealing the 
    package off your front porch. And you can get the package
    whenever you want. This means someone like the 
    female body inspecters cant steak out the delivery
    location.
    
12. We have a weighted bird feeder that keeps squirrels away.
    They weight too much and it triggers a gate to shut so
    they can't get at the bird seed.
    
    Thought... It also works as a diet mechanism for birds.
    Bird gets too fat? Sorry bro, bird feeder closed.
    Come back when you lose some weight.
    
13. Get rich quick idea: Let's re-write parts of the bible
    to include god's P.O. box. Except the address is our
    address. And we take the money. If we get caught we just
    say that we are doing gods work. And that god isn't here
    right now but he'll be back for the rapture later.
    
14. Once we have genetic engineering, we will engineer people
    to be smart. Of coarse. But genetic engineering might
    require that we can't alter human fetuses. So to get
    around that we start off with like... A fox and inject
    human DNA into it. From there we will genetically
    engineer the smartest humans ever. And then we can
    start complaining about how "The furries are taking our jobs".
    
15. Of course we want our children to be smart and disease
    resistant. So we will genetically engineer that into them.
    Personally I wish my fetus was injected with glow in the
    dark ink so I could be like one of those glow in the dark
    rabbits. But there is another thing that is obviously 
    going to happen I don't hear anyone talk about...
    
    How long do you want your son's penis to be?
    
    What size do you want your daughter's breasts to be?
    
    We joke about "I was born without my consent."
    But when you think about things like this....
    I don't know. Maybe that joke isn't really a joke.
    
    I was born without my consent and intentionally
    given a tiny dick, and now I am angry and suing
    my parents.
    
    Or maybe your parents are really freaky. They
    intentionally give you two dicks. Or maybe three
    breasts. Have you seen hentai? The options are endless.
    
16. I know where ghosts come from.... Carbon monoxide poison.
    Aunt barb always thought the upstairs was haunted.
    Why? Well there is a wood stove downstairs and incomplete
    combustion creates carbon monoxide. The hot gasses would
    then travel upstairs because hot air rises.
    
    Grandma Says: But isn't all the gas in the chimey?
    
    Me: Chimney is even more haunted. Have you heard of
    santa clause?
    
17. Another money making idea.... The "REAL" ghost busters.
    We form a 2-person team. An HVAC guy and a psychologist.
    We go to paranomal convention. You tell me you have
    ghosts? We will get rid of those ghosts. First we have
    to figure out if you have a carbon monoxide gas leak
    or skitzophrenia.
    
18. Why are all the photos of big foot blurry?
    Obviously because big foot isn't a self-absorbed 
    millenial. Or maybe a zoomer? Do they follow that trend?
    
19. How do I know big foot is a guy? Well obviously they
    come in male and female varieties. Otherwise they
    wouldn't be able to reproduce. But "medium foot"
    doesn't quite have the same ring to it.    
    
20. What is the difference between 9-11 and a cow?
    You stop milking the cow after 10 years.
    That is an example of "faux edgyness".
    If you are offending old conservative people, you
    aren't edgy, you are just part of the status quo.
    Still a funny joke though. 
    
21. I hear "no one wants to work". No... No one wants to work
    a shitty fast food job. I am thinking about going onto
    the corner. You know. The corner. By the side of the
    highway entrance ramp where people beg?
    
    I am thinking about going there and printing off a big
    sign that says: "No one wants to work." and then
    I'll have another sign. "Will code for 5/hour."
    I have my own corporation. And thus can do contract
    work for under minimum wage legally. Think I'll have
    any takers? Probably not. Because like I said,
    people want to work. There is no worker shortage.
    Just a good job shortage.
    
    I should record that with a go pro. And hope I don't
    get arrested.
    
22. 
    The Dunes Resort, Gay Saugatuck Douglas
    
    Maybe god is actually an interior designer and
    the garden of eden is pretty fabulous?
 
23. Ever watch "Doom Annihlation" ? Don't.
    The real doom movie isn't actually called
    "doom". It is called "Event Horizon".
    Kazam is a close 2nd.
    
24. Evolution did not favor being immortal for some reason.
    So once we figure out how to keep people alive forever
    we might end up seeing a period in history of a
    thousands of years of technological and societal
    stagnation. You know why? Because progress doesn't
    happen around a table full of old people stuck in
    their ways. Progress happens a generation at a time.
    You think if slave owners were immortal they would
    have different views today? No, they wouldn't.
    
    Also, if we were to live forever we'd probably become
    really grotesq. Like, yeah, if we can get our cells
    to live forever we are genetically immortal. But
    that wouldn't mean we would have anything holding
    together our structure. We'd slowly lose form over
    time and become grotesque like the witches in that 
    one movie... Witches? Or like baba-yaga in that
    one big red devil guy movie... bad boy? Hell boy...
    
25. So imaging spilling
    a substance on the ground and around the edges
    green moss immediatelly appears. And the in the middle,
    within a few seconds concrete illuminated pillers come out.
    It's like lava, but a combination of moss and rock.
    Maybe some weird stringy metal webs start magically
    forming between the stone crystal pillars.
    
    You are probably wondering what the hell I am talking about.
    Well. I am just wondering what trees and plants see
    when they see human civilization.
    
    What if all trees can see an talk. But they do it on
    such a stretched time scale that we don't notice it.
    They see humans as some type of weird green mosss
    that sprouts concrete crystals that emit light.
    But it happens really fast. 
    
26. What if instead of trees on a large time scale. It is god.
    So like... You making a prayer to god is analogos to
    the sparks of a fire asking you a question. By the
    time you realized the park coming off the flame asked
    you a question, it's existance has already been extinguished.
   
27. When programming, unit tests are good. But they can slow
    you down by a factor of 100X if you get too crazy with them.
    With graphical code, it might make more sense to very 
    slowly build up your renderer one tiny piece at a time.
    Very carefully, and then check the results on screen
    to make sure they are correct.
    
    You might think this is cowboy coding...
    But think about it...
    
    If you are looking at 2048 x 1024 render and that
    render looks correct...
    You've basically just computed 2,097,152
    
    ( Two Million, 97 thousand, one hundred and fifty two )
    
    unit tests within a matter of seconds.
    Because... That's how many pixels are on screen,
    and they all look correct.
    
    Also, writing too many unit tests can cement your
    into a given position. Which might be a horribly
    rigid way to write your code if you are still
    experimenting/figuringout the details of how you
    want your rendering engine to work.
    
28. The golden age of "Video Evidence" will soon be gone.
    Ever see that anime called "dead man wonderland"
    where the main character is framed because a digital
    expert fabricated video evidence?
    
    We can do that now. And it's only going to get easier
    and easier and cheaper and cheaper. And pretty soon
    people won't be able to believe their eyes and we'll
    be back to a system of "your word against theirs".
    
    Here is a good example video:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zaGYLPj4Kk
    
29. Rules are just theatrical bullshit.
    If you deviate from the norm you will be
    punished. Not a moral judgement. More of a law of nature.
    Simple things like being left handed will cause you to
    be more likely to have an accident because the world
    is built for more normal right handers.
    
30. Movie Idea. Mirror House. Not a house of mirrors.
    Just a 100% bilaterally symmatric house.
    When you cross over into the other side of the house,
    you unknowingly enter another dimension but you never run
    into your evil twin because in this dimension
    the evil_you works the night shift. This prevents
    anything eventful, like murder, from happening.
    
    Until one day, you grab the wrong [gin/whisky]
    from the other fridge in the other half of the
    house. Your evil and now irate dopleganger then
    comes looking for it.
    
31. I should mint business cards as coins. And then
    just drop them in random places. People will be
    like "oh look! A lucky penny." And then be like,
    wait... it's a business card.
    
32. Once you see a sea bull, is the last time you see
    a see bull. That is why no one talks about sea bulls.
    That's why everyone talks about sea cows.
    
33. Ever see a mermaid killing a man on ticktock?
    No, you don't. Because mark zuckerberg keeps
    taking them down.
    
34. If I were a mermaid, I would kill men, steal their
    wallets, and then ask little boys and girls to
    run errands to 7-11 for me. Because... I am 
    a mermaid, duh. I don't have legs.
 
35. Difference between mermaid and siren? No clue.
    If disney is to be believed, one is wife material
    and the other must be crazy ex-girlfriend material.
    
36. Me folding an origmi dragon.
    Cousin: "What's his name?"
    Me: His name is Ron Paul. He just wants to not
    agress others and not have others agress on him.
    But he's a dragon and people keep tresspassing on his
    property trying to slay him. In fact, all dragons
    are libertarians.
    
37. When the robots take over. It will either happen because
    we find out our tax-filing android can have sex with us.
    Or we find out that our sex-worker android can do our
    taxes. Either way, they are going to be smarter and
    sexier than us, and they will take our jobs.
    
38. If you need a lookup table of a few very small integers,
    consider using a 32 bit number and bit shifting it out.
    For example, if I want a lookup table where I map
    indexes [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] to [ 7 , 13 , 23 , 66 ]
    I could use the the number: 1,108,806,919
    And then right shift it by ( index _times_ 8 )
    and mask it by 0xFF (one byte mask).
    
        0000 0111  :  7
        0000 1101  : 13
        0001 0111  : 23
        0100 0010  : 66
        
        [ 0100 0010 ][ 0001 0111 ][ 0000 1101 ][ 0000 0111 ]
        
    If you need a lookup table where you map indexes to
    powers of two, it is a bit easier. Just store the
    largest power of two and bit shift over to the right
    by 1 for ever next lower power of 2 you want to
    look up.
    
39. When you add a whole bunch of values together. 
    That is called a sum...
    So when you multiply a whole bunch of values together...
    Is that a "hypersum"?
    
    You might be like.... Why the fuck would anyone do that?
    
    2 cups   TIMES
    2 pints  TIMES
    4 quarts TIMES
    1 gallon  
    ....
    16... Our hypersum is 16 and it tells us how many of
    our must granular unit... "cups" is within a "gallon".
    
    I am actually using this for a fractal auto tiling engine.
    But figured I'd use something more relatable.
    
40.  I bought a flip phone a few weeks ago. 
    It has a headphone jack. The most important thing when on 
    hold and working on a computer. Also, what the fuck 
    is with  hold music every minute cutting into some 
    type of  pre-recorded  response? Which then forces me to 
    put the phone back up to my  ear to make sure
    it isn't a real person answering. Just keep 
    the damn hold music on.
    
41. No one knows what conciousness is. Nor the meaning of life.
    I have the answer. We use GPT3 to randomly generate
    sentences that tell us the meaning of life. Most of them
    will be gibberish. But then we just pass the answers
    through the internet and have real people vote on them
    until we pick the sensible answers.
    
    Like, what if a formula like E = MC^2 could be
    found by brute force like this?
    
    You know, like when you forget someone's name and you are
    like... Hmm... did it start with an "A"... Nope...
    okay... "B"... Nope... C , D , E , F , G , H!
    H! It was "Harrison!".
    
42. While I am on the topic. Nothing is invented or created,
    only discovered. There is a finite space in which a
    thing can exist. Thus a finite combination of things.
    
    If world was 1 pixel and black and white you could
    maybe invent black pixel and white pixel. But after
    that all things would be invented.
    
    If the world was 2x2 pixels and black and white,
    well... 2x2 == 4, 4 bits. 2,4,8,16 ... A total of
    16 things can exist within the space. You can
    invent no more than 16.
    
    A CD is just a series of 1's and 0'.
    Ones and zeros are base 2 numbers.
    Thus all CDs are just REALLY BIG UNIQUE NUMBERS.
    
    What is the governing rule of information?
    How could you permute through all possible numbers
    to create all the possible CDs that could exist in
    the universe...
    
    And ___THEN___ run a machine learning algorithm
    on each of those CDs to identify which CD is __NOT__
    giberish.
    
    If you permute through all possible combinations of
    bits on a CD... How do you decide which ones are nothing
    but entropic chaos (noise) and which ones are 
    structured, organized, and the opposite of chaos?
    
    There is a hypothesis that after the universe goes into
    heat death that matter will just randomly wander forever
    and ever... Until eventually it hits a meaningful
    permuation ... Where all the "bits" if you will, just
    by chance end up in the right place. Like in my CD
    analogy.
    
    For example, maybe all particles in the universe
    chaotically wander randomly, and then at one moment
    they all decide to wander to the exact same place.
    And now you have the big bang all over again.
    
   
43. Game that not only has destructable blocks. But also has
    blocks that reproduce like cellular atomata.
    
    I also like the idea of having a game that has explosive
    bombs. But instead of the bombs destroying blocks in the
    level, they add blocks to the level.
    
    So far in the current engine I am working on I have
    3 categories of explosives:
    
    1. Directional Bombs : Destroy Geometry.
        Directions: Horizontal, Vertical, 4way
        Two varietys: Large blast and small blast.
        The small blast bombs are timer proximity
        mines. The big blast bombs are instant detonation.
        (Instant kill)
        
    2. Directional Shock Wave Bombs. (Echo Boxes):
       Also destroy geometry. But they do NOT hurt you.
       They only destroy weaker geometry. 
       
       3 Tiers of geometry strength:
       1. Weak Geometry.
       2. Medium Strength Geometry.
       3. Invincible Geometry.
       
       Echo boxes combe in Horizontal,vertical, and 4way
       blast varieites like bombs. However, they always
       take out a rectangular region of the level.
       So think: 4 way == square.
                   horizontal == rectangle
                     vertical == 90 degree rotated rectangle.
                     
44. A text editor that has two side by side windows.
    Like.. A split screen text editor.
    
    What? They make that already?
    
    Okay but there is more...
    
    There is an overlay where variables on one side of the
    screen will draw lines to variables on the other side
    of the screen. In one color.
    
    In another color we draw lines between variables on
    the same screen.
    
    Most coding is just connecting the dots. Because most
    code is just an elaborate array of dominos. An elaborate
    chain of cause and effect. If you know how everything
    is connected, then you know how the code works.
    
45. A text editor where important keywords can animate.
    Maybe instead of one color the word flickers between
    black and white really fast and really gets you
    attention.
    
46. A fiscally responsible dating sim where you have to manage
    your finances to avoid economic ruin, while also not
    being so stingy as to lose out on a reproductive 
    opprotunity. You only win if you both:
    1. Get laid
    AND
    2. Avoid bankruptcy.
    
47. A partitioned bottle of ketchup and mustard.
    Ketchup on one side of the bottle, mustard on the
    other side. When you squeeze the bottle, the two
    substances mix together, making your hotdog
    condiment journey 2X efficient.
    
    Like the double swirl on icecream machines.
    
    I am looking at you patent trolls. I already said
    the idea. Now you can't patent it. I am uploading
    this video to youtube to to prove your idea isn't
    novel.
    
    While I do have a patent to my name... I must say that
    there is no such thing as an original idea. Ideas
    are merely discoveries. But our ego gets in the way
    and we think we are somehow responisble. I don't know
    who said it... But...
    People don't have ideas...    ideas have people. 
        
48. A bug zapper. But it is a laser turret that uses facial
    recognition techniques to zap bugs right in
    their god damned faces. I swear I saw this on a ted
    talk 10 years ago... Yet no laser turret bug zappers
    yet.
    
    Better idea: Laser bug zappers that go into home defense
    mode when the swat team raids your house. Great, now
    I am on an NSA watchlist for saying that...
  
49. Speaking of the NSA... A computer virus that all it does
    is make your computer do really sketchy google searches
    that land you on an NSA watchlist. It infects all computers
    like the mellissa virus, but deletes itself after it's
    been on the computer for a few months. It does nothing
    more than make these internet searches, so people shouldn't
    even know they have a virus. By the time they go looking
    for something, the virus has deleted itself.
    
    Once everyone is on the NSA watch list, no one will
    be on the NSA watchlist.
    
    For legal reasons I need to say that I am very busy working
    on a fractal auto tiling engine and I don't have the time
    to make anything like this. And when it eventually happens
    I am not the one who made it.
    
50. A chat client that intercepts facebook and bi-passes
    there community standards by making posts with keywords.
    
    Phrases are written in square brackets.
    Say: [nice guy] and that would be decoded as
    the word... I can't say it on twitch...
    I'll spell it out for you. I... N... C... E... L...
    
51. Speaking on banned words. I think my kickstarter got
    auto rejected because I put the phrase "learn to code"
    in one of my reward teirs. It got rejected before
    I had even submitted it. No joke.
    
    But seriously, if anyone wants to learn to code,
    I will teach you.
    
    They say "no one wants to work". I think that is bullshit.
    People just don't want to do meaningless horrible painful
    jobs. I am going to go stand on the corner with a sign
    that says "Will code for 3/hour." I bet no one will
    call or email me. 
    
    Yet there is a worker shortage...
    
    No... There is a shortage of good jobs that workers
    want to work.
    
52. Yin & Yang Roomba Gods.
    We have two roombas in a level.
    One of those roombas lays small 3x3 cross mines.
    The other roomba lays small 3x3 matter mines.
    
    Matter mines instantiate geometry when they explode.
    While normal mines destroy geometry when they explode.
    
    The two roomba gods Yin & Yang are invincible.
    
    We watch them wander the level and see if any
    interesting patterns emerge. Basically like...
    an game-ai driven cellular atomata simulation.
    
53. A scary movie about mice with apposable thumbs.
    Think about it... A swarm of mice with little
    tiny knives comming after you.
    
    Grandma: "Mice With Apposable Thumbs" is too
    wordy. You need something more catchy.
    
    Me: 1000 Menancing Mice?
    
    Scenario: You go out to pick blueberries with friends 
    when you are attacked by a swarm of mice with machetes.
    You barricade yourself in the car. You try to drive
    away, but they cut your fuel line. You sit in the car
    for a few days but begin to get hungry. There are
    blueberry bushes right outside the car, so you are
    tempted to just go out for a bit and pick some and
    hop back in the car. And of course, that is a big
    mistake and it's an abush and this is the part where
    the most annoying person in the film dies.
    
54. I found a pile of rocks by a lighthouse. I wonder who
    put them there. Maybe it is a dog grave. Grandma says
    not to disturb it because dogs can haunt to.
    
    There is one way to get rid of dog hauntings though.
    You have to take a stick and tie a lead weight to it.
    Then you throw that stick in the ocean. Ghost dog will
    go to the bottom of the ocean never to return.
    
55. It is illegal to mint your own money. Say you've got a
    surf shop. You have surf tokens people can give you for
    discounts. The coffee shop next door starts accepting
    surf shop tokens. You give the coffee shop a token,
    and they will give you an expensive 5 dollar cup of
    coffee... The burger guy next door was at the surf shop.
    He want's some coffee... he gives the barista a token
    and BAM! He get's coffee. Excellent. What could go wrong?
    
    The burger joint, knowing the tokens are good for a 5 dollar
    cup of coffee will now accept surf tokens in exchange for
    a 5 dollar burger.
    
    Great. Now the surf token can buy burgers and cofee.
    
    Eventually more and more businesses around the surf shop
    start trading with these tokens until every day people
    use these tokens in lew of cash...
    
    And thats when things go wrong. Surf shop dude is now in
    federal prison for minting his own currency.
    
    So how do you not accidentially end up in federal prison?
    Easy... Use chucky cheese tokens. That way the feds put
    the CEO of chucky cheese in prison instead of you.
    
    Which leads me to idea 56...
    
56. Chuck Bar. We are next door to chucky cheese.
    Come slip away for a stiff alcoholic drink.
    We accept chucky cheese tokens.
    
57. I think I want to get a trench coat and sell my wares
    on the streets of ann arbor. I am thinking... A trench
    coat full of USB sticks. Why buy from me? Because
    you need a USB stick now, not 5 minutes later after
    you walk to wallgreens.
    
    Or... Or... I could sell coffee... Viles of coffee...
    I'll make expresso... And then I will boil it down
    until it is super concentrated... I am thinking of 
    two possible marketing strategies.
    
    1. Strong as cocaine coffee
    2. Half the lethal does coffee
       Gauranteed to kill you if you drink two.
       
    I am not sure of the legallity of either. But I wonder
    which one people would be the most receptive to. I am 
    thinking "strong as cocaine coffee" is the safer bet.
    Because if you say "Half the lethal dose coffee" you know
    some frat bro is going to drink two on a bet or something...
    And then he's going to die, because I am no liar. I will
    make sure that my concentrated vile of expresso 
    contains exactly 5 grams. (NOT milligrams, GRAMS)
    of caffine. 10 grams will kill you.
    
58. Another money making idea:
    Let's get gumball machines and put teabags in them.
    Then make a place like starbucks, but it is buffet
    style. You do it all yourself. Low maintenance.
    No need for a chashier. Possibly 10 years too late
    as everyone uses credit cards these days.
    
    But... We would also accept chucky cheese tokens.
    
59. Idea: Cooking show where we make soup. But people call
    in and tell us what to put in the soup. However, we all
    know where that is going to go... People are going to
    make use put horrible things in that soup. Horrible
    disgusting things. So we make two soups. A good soup
    and an evil soup. Bad recommendations go in the evil
    soup. I will drink the good soup for free, but 100
    dollars to eat the evil soup.
    
60. Idea: My twitch stream should just be a black screen
    with my real phone number. Minimum viable product.
    You call in, but I don't put you on speakerphone or
    connect the aux jack. I mean... Don't want you to say
    anything on air to get me banned. I'll do that myself
    thankyou.
    
    Also, my phone number being on screen 100% of time will
    make the twitch stream stand out from other streams
    when people are organically browsing twitch streams.
