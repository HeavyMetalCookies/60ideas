
1. Do you think squirrels have a sense of justice?
   Grandma: No.
   What about dolphins?
   Grandma: They are smarter. Probably. Also discrimenatory.
   
2. Going into space is scary. You can't be afraid to die.
   Scared of heights? Space is about as high from earth
   as you can get. If you get stranded on an island you
   at least have hope. Get ejected from the space station
   and thrown into the void of space... Yeah... No hope there.
   It would be less scary to be burried in a coffin at
   the bottom of the ocean. But... A sinking submarine
   is a close 2nd for scary things I would like to avoid.
   
3. If you get too good at math you go skitzophrenic.
   I am up to my ass in crazy numbers. I might go crazy.
   
   Grandma: Who said that?
   Me: Nash
   Grandma: Nash Ogden?
   Me: No, Nash from nash equilibrium theorum.
   
   He is dead and I missed his funeral.
   Grandma: Especially because you weren't even born then.
   Me; I was born a bad friend.
   
4. Lines of code is said to be a poor metric for measuring
   progress. I think that is a "low resolution" understanding
   of lines of code.
   
   Yes, lines of code is bad for measuring progress against
   other people who write code with a different information
   density.
   
   If you write well thought out code with high information
   density, I think lines of code is a great metric.
   
   If you consistently write low information density code,
   or poorly thought out code....
   
   Still a great metric for progress.
   
   If you are highly inconsistent with the quality of your
   code, then yeah. Lines of code won't be a good metric.
   If you are comparing your code against others, probably
   not a good metric either.
   
   But... There is a minimum number of bits of information
   needed to get something done. As you add lines of code,
   hopefully you are adding to those bits.
   
   Been watching a lex fridman podcast talking about
   "assembly theory".
   
5. Do you think fish know they are in water?
   Grandma: Yes.
   Me: How
   
   Grandma: Do you know you are in air? Do you think they
   are stupid? If they didn't know they would be a lot
   easier to catch.
   
   Me: They would just wander onto the earth?
   Grandma: Yes. And you were once a fish.
   So you have to be nice to them.
   
   Me: Evolutionarily.
   Grandma: Yes.
   Grandma: Have you been nice to the fish?
   
   Me: Yes. By giving them a swift death by eating them
       at the grocery store where they are already dead.
   Grandma: Someone caught them. how did they get in the
   grocery store?
   
   Me: Looking for jobs. The only thing they could sell
       was their body.
       
   Grandma: But they have no place to spend money.
   So why do they need money?
   
   Me: Status.
   
   Grandma: Status has to do with buying. What could they
   buy?
   
   Me: Lambo.
   
   Grandma: HOw they going to drive it?
   Me: Apposable thumbs. They can buy those too.
   Me: Prosthetics technology has come a long way.
   
   Grandma: Where they going to drive it?
   Me: To the club. Fish Club. First rule of fish
   club is don't talk about fish club.
   
   Grandma: What do they do at fish club.
   Me: They fish.
   Grandma: What do they fish for.
   Me: Can't talka bout that.
   Granma: who said?
   Me: I just said earlier.
   
   Grandma: How are they going to have a sand trap?
   Me: Have you ever seen spongue bob? They can do it?
   But are they golfing?
   
   Me: Spong bob is the greatest depiction of the deep
   sea to date. The scientists gave the creator a nobel
   prize.
   
6. What if the rapture of the bible already happened and
   we are not the choosen ones to go to heaven.
   Hell is actually on earth, but it isn't that bad
   because the devil is a self serving ayn rand
   capitalist.
   
7. What if a key to photo realistic physically based rendering
   is __NOT__ multi sampling or super sampling... But rather
   sudo-random single-sampling that is temporaly blended?
   
   You only have so many cones and rods in your eye right?
   So technically shouldn't your vision be anti-aliased with
   rendering artifacts just like in 3D?
   
   What if... Instead of interference of wave lengths of light
   creating smooth edges... it just the probability of different
   wavelengths of light reaching a certain cone or rod in your
   eye being blended over time?
   
   My hypothesis is probably complete bullshit to the level
   of quackery of old philosophers who thought we shot rays
   out of our eyes to see things.
   
   But just like "shooting rays out of your eyes" is a pretty
   good way to do "signed distance field ray tracing", my
   crackpot hypothesis might be a decent way to write a
   renderer as well.
   
8. Everything is this cabin is a container.
   Grandma: Even this cabin is a container.
   Me: This toaster? A container for toast.
   Me: This salt shaker. Obvious.
   Me: This bread? A container to easily transport calories.
   Me: These glasses? Containers for lenses.
   Me: Table? It's an open container to put stuff on top of.
   
   Am I going crazy. Someone tell me something that isn't a
   container. Molecules and atoms maybe? Gravity? Light?

9. Grandma: We don't get as many months of summers as texas.
   Me: Texas got all the good stuff. Guns and summer.
   Grandma: But they also have rattle snakes.
   Me: If I find a rattle snake, I am going to shoot it in
   the face. They would do the same to me if they could.
   Grandma: How are they going to shoot you, they don't
   have thumbs.
   Me: Yeah, they gave up that priviledge via a few millions
   of years of bad decision making.
   
   Did you know that snakes used to be lizards?
   But they stole apples off of the tree of knowledge
   of good and evil. And just like in that Aladin movie,
   they chopped off all the lizard's hands and feet because
   he was a theife.
   
   But the lizard didn't learn his lesson. He was all like,
   "Hey buddy. Get me some apples off of that apple tree."
   And then adam and eve got apples off the apple tree.
   But then the bastards didn't share with the lizard.
   So the lizard snitched on adam and eve and told god
   about it.
   
   So in conclusion, snitches get bullets in the face.
   And by snitches, I mean rattle snakes if you haven't
   been following along.
   
10. The proper way to cross a river is to build a log cabin
    and wait 128 days until the river freezes over.
    Because patients is a virtue or something.
    
11. 
    Me: Did you know if you vaporize diesel fuel and use
    it as an explosive the force rivals small nuclear arms?
    
    Grandma: Why would you do that?
    
    Me: To kill people and take their stuff probably.
    
    Grandma: But why would you steal?
    
    Me: I don't know. Probably because they won't give
    it to you.
    
12. Mushroom cells are not quite plant cells and not quite
    animal cells. They are a hybrid inbetween.
    So that makes me think...
    
    Mushrooms... Twice as good as plants.
    Half as good as meat.
    
    If this statement is true, how many units of
    good is plants. And how many units of good
    is meat?
    
    The answer is : 1,2,4...
    Holy shit.. It is logarithmic.
    
13. Idea:
    I tried to make a mirrored brush for painting sub-tiles
    within a fractal auto tile set. It didn't work very well
    as the lack of structure came through in the final
    design.
    
    Garbage in, garbage out.
    
    But... What if you created a free-form mirrored painting
    application that used high resoution pixels. And it
    fluxuated the brush size and color as you painted.
    
    Generating some type of painterly kaliedoscope.
    I've done this before. Here is a screenshot:
    
    https://i.imgur.com/I95tvEC.png
    
    So... take this... And then downfilter it into tile
    values in the same way that you would create a photo
    mosiac by getting the average color within a certain
    partition of pixels.
    
    Maybe the end result would have more pleasing
    structure.
    
14. I found some nicorett gum on the street. Still in it's
    pack. I don't smoke. Should I chew it to get high?


15. If evolution works, why are there still monkeys?

    Why are there still monkeys? 
    It leads to even more questions... If evolution works, 
    why is there still bacteria? Better yet. If evolution 
    works, why aren't 100% of all organisms human?
    And finally, the most perplexing question for your know 
    it all scientists... If evolution works, whey are 
    there still charmanders, pikachus, and bulbasaurs?

16. Anti-vaxxers have one thing on their side as a population.
    Lack of genetic drift. I don't think you breed disease
    resistant crops by growing them in a sterile environment.
    
17. The best weapon to slay a dragon with is a plastic spoon.
    If you slay a dragon with a magical sword the towns
    people are just going to be like, "You didn't do any work!"
    "The sword did it all for you!" "I am not paying for that!"
    
    Which is a faulty premis. As the townspeople are not paying
    for "how hard it was to slay the dragon" but rather for
    the service provided. If people only paid for things that
    were hard to do, we would have no motive to make technology
    more efficient and better humankind. We'd never have
    an industrial revolution.
    
    But anyways. These are mid-evil towns people and this
    argument is above their head. So just slay the dragon
    with a plastic spoon, impress, them, and get your payday.
    
18. I was working food prep and we got black nitrile gloves.
    Got me thinking... I should go around with black gloves
    and give random strangers compliments. But after each
    compliment I say:
    
    "It would be a shame if something happened to it."
    
    Nice hair, be a shame if something happened to it.
    Nice  car, be a shame if something happened to it.
    Cute  dog, be a shame if something happened to it.
    
19. We should sell cucumber flowers as luxury high end flowers.
    Kind of like how kings ate chicken but peasants didn't.
    Because its a huge monitary flex to just butcher an egg
    producing bird and eat it.
    
    In the same way, it's a huge flex to butcher a cucumber
    so you can have a flower.
    
20. If you told someone 400 years ago that every day people
    would wrap potatos in aluminum foil, cook them, and then
    throw away the foil...
    
    They would say:
        No way anyone could be that rich in the future!
    
    Then you tell them:
        Nope, they aren't rich, they are actually poor.
        They have these things called "land lords" they
        give most of their money to.
        
    And that's when you'd become the town fool.
    Because aluminum was once worth more than gold.
    
    Napoleon gave his guests gold and silver utensils.
    But the aluminum was reserved for him.
    
 21. Garden lawn gnomes should actually be robotic samsites
     used to fend off drone strikes. When the singularity
     comes, you will want to be on team Gnome.
     
 22. Ah. I see. What if existence is like a 
     programming language with managed memory 
     and once you are removed from all discord 
     groups you die because the garbage collector 
     flags you?
     
 23. If we discover all scientific discovery was done
     under the influence of drugs, do we legalize
     drugs or do we outlaw science?
     
     Grandma: Why not both?
 
 24. Grandma: How do you know oxygen is on the moon?
     Me: Youtube documentary.
     Grandma: And what were you doing watching a moon
     documentary?
     Me: A burning hot cup of coffee spoke to me and told
     me it was my destiny to watch moon documentary.
     Grandma: And how did they get a documentary about
     the moon up on the internet?
     Me: Well, it all started when god was bored and
     wanted to watch some T.V. But T.V. wasn't invented
     yet so they planted the tree of the knowledge of
     good and evil in the garden of eden. Five minutes
     later (in god timescale) there is T.V. blaring
     in the garden of eden. Book god is pretty pissed
     about what the other gods did, and kicks the humans
     out of the garden of eden.
     
     Humans, though obviously intelligent enough to make
     it in the world on their own are a bit butt hurt.
     So they begin engaging in a form of self-harm
     called "war" to act out. Then in a case of the
     most twisted pathology ever, the humans, who have
     brought disaster amongst themselves, ask god why
     there is war and suffering in the world.
     
     And that's why we don't have T.V. in the cabin
     and I was watching a moon documentary.
     
 25. Get a horse... Drill a small hole in it's skull.
     NOT ALL THE WAY THROUGH! A shallow hole.
     Then get some riendeer bone marrow stem cells.
     Inject into cavity.
     Wait...
     Unicorn.
     Now open unicorn farm.
     
     Also, the animals on Noah's ark were freeloaders
     that couldn't fly. Oh wait.. That is a pegasus
     not a unicorn.
     
26. Honey badger vs pine martin. Who wins?
    Grandma: Pine Martin.
    Pine Martin and Honey Badger should be unlockable
    characters in mortal kombat. Change my mind.
    
    Wait... Air Bud... But instead of basketball... MMA.
    
    "There is no rule that a pine martin can't play MMA!"
    Or maybe since more people know about honey badgers:
    "There is no rule that a honey badger can't play MMA!"
    
    PITCHED TO DISCORD:
    
    Has anyone seen "Air Bud" ?
    Zii — Today at 9:08 PM
    Sounds familiar
    So I probably hate it
    Klock — Today at 9:08 PM
    Golden Retriever basketball?
    Zii — Today at 9:08 PM
    I knew it was some kind of dog sport but thought baseball
    A movie with two things I hate
    Klock — Today at 9:09 PM
    I feel like the kid was an orphan
    half way house with a caretaker that treated him nasty 
    until air bud came along
    ...
    or I could be remembering a completely different movie
    I reached fairly deep in my mindvault
    Zii — Today at 9:17 PM
    I think children who liked these shows should kill 
    themselves

    J4M4I5M7 — Today at 9:17 PM
    Here me out....
    RomnyHasagawa — Today at 9:17 PM
    LMFAO
    brb, killing myself
    Even though I only watched the first one LMFAO
    I liked it
    J4M4I5M7 — Today at 9:18 PM
    Air bud.... But MMA and a honey badger.
    "There is no rule that a honey badger can't play MMA!"
    Zii — Today at 9:18 PM
    Did you read the rules?
    J4M4I5M7 — Today at 9:18 PM
    Also.... Honey Badger as an unlockable character in 
    mortal kombat.
    J4M4I5M7 — Today at 9:19 PM
    No. It was a paraphrase of a quote in the movie air bud.
    But it is likely that if we searched the rules, we 
    would not find restrictions against honey badgers.
    Zii — Today at 9:25 PM
    You'd find other limiting keywords that include 
    restrictions such as "non-consenting citizens"
    J4M4I5M7 — Today at 9:26 PM
    So what you are saying is that you want to wreck a 
    wholesome kid's movie because reality got in the way?
        
27. Computers are golumns.
    Grandma: Golumns are made with mud and prayers.
    Me: Science is the new better religion.
    Throw some lightning in that rock and get it thinking!
    
28. Forrest creatures are as entitled as fuck. Tresspassing
    on your front lawn at all hours of the day. Eating
    your flowers and sugarplums.
    
    We should go deer hunting. But use Bolos.
    Bolos for deer. Boloing for deer. 
    
29. 
    I decided on a political platform for presidency.
    If I am elected. I will air drop 1 handgun for 
    every citizen on north korea. And then just see 
    what happens. Since I am pro gun I'll run as a 
    democrat, and get republican and democrat votes. 
    It's a solid plan. 
    Can't possibly fail.
    
30. What if immortals existed but then we killed them all
    because:
    
    1. Though biologically immortal, the overall bone
    structure would grow grotesque over time. For example,
    if you break your arm and mend it together, at the
    cell level you are fine. But at the gestalt level,
    you have slighly altered your overall form. Such
    errors could compound over time making you look like
    baba yaga from the hellboy movie.
    
    Also, I hear your ears and nose never stop growing.
    Which might explain witches. Maybe they were just
    immortal humans.
    
    2. Statistically, the older you are the richer you are.
    Because you've had more time to hustle. More time to
    play the game. You've grinded your character money
    earning stats longer. This could lead to animosity.
    "Eat the rich" is a saying now. Imagine if you were
    both RICH and UGLY. It would make it doubly easy to
    dehumanize you and kill you.
    
    And you already want their riches. You just need a
    justification to take them. 
    
31. Idea: Fill pot holes with glow in the dark epoxy.
    Just dress up in some orange vests from party city 
    and get some traffic cones. Do it in the middle of 
    the morning. No one will question us.

    I've heard of the guy who painted dicks on potholes to get  
    the city to fix them, but I think the idea of random shit 
    in the  road glowing more. Also epoxy is really strong so
    your fixup job would last a lot longer than the tar & 
    rocks they put in  pot holes.
    
32. What percentage of human DNA does a genetic experiment 
    have to have before eating it is considered cannibalism? 
    Asking for a friend. 

33. Club strategy.
    SO... this isn't going to be believable. 
    But every time I get on a stripper pole I intimidate 
    all the girls and they say "Yeah, I can't follow that."

    So maybe the appropriate thing to do is just be like, 
    "Look at that ass of yours! Now look at mine. Yes you can!"
    
34. Club strategy.
    VR. But for fleshlights.

    You get a dildo that has a lot of sensors in it and 
    then get a... performer to suck on it.

    Then you get a fleshlight that has a lot of tiny actuators 
    in the same place that those sensors where and it 
    replays the actions originally done by the... performer.
    
35.
    Anyone stupid enough to point a gun at someone they don't 
    intend to shoot is not someone smart enough to trust that 
    "it isn't loaded".
    
36. What can you say during sex that you can also say at dinner?

    Anything you want because free speech. 
    Just remember that freedom of speech is 
    not freedom of consequences. Stick to 
    politically correct intentionally 
    ambiguous language. 
    Like "please pass the meat lube". 
    Is that butter or baby oil? No one knows.
    
37. 
What is the moral of the story jack and the bean stalk?
Grandma: Don't trust peddlers.
    So you wouldn't buy a magic bean stalk?
    I would. Then I would charge money to see it.
    Are you going to visit "mystery spot" or "awesome
    bean stalk to the sky?"
Grandma: People will visit either.
    As long as I have their address, I will feel fine
    buying from bean peddler. And if I get ripped off
    they can always offer me a refund or we can
    do an exchange.
Grandma: Exchange of what?
    Bullets.
    
38. Clippy Virus From Microsoft word.
    But it only shows up when it detects that you are
    engaging in illegal activity.
    
    "Hey! I see you are trying to write a ransom letter."
    "Would you like some help?"
    
    "Hey! I see you are planning a murder."
    "Would you like tips on making it look like an accident?"
    
    "Hey! I see you are trying to smuggle some drugs."
    "Did you know that any disrespect intended or accidential"
    "could get you killed by the drug cartels?"
    "Would you like me to check your spanish?"
    
39.
    Apple is going to start scanning phones for
    "images of child abuse"...
    
    This will eventually happen:
    Step1: Guy films his flat chested girlfriend giving him a bl0wjob.
    Step2: Flagged as child pornography.
    Step3: Reviewed by human team.
    Step4: Images somehow end up on p0rnhub.
    Step5: Woman sues ex boyfriend for defamation of character for releasing personal videos.
    Step6: Guy swears up and down that he didn't share the pictures.
    Step7: No media coverage, because no one realizes apple spying is responsible.
    
40. 
    Idea: Become detective and plant really specific fortune
          cookie fortunes at the crime scenes.
          
          Fortune: You will be stabbed to death by your 
                   girlfriend's ex-boyfriend.
                   
41.
    Predators can actually see color, but they have rules.
    Just like in the continental. 
    
42.
    Did you know that when a wheel comes off of a vehicle 
    on the highway, it can decapitate people? 
    Also, a blast from a shotgun can blow someone's head off.

    Sometimes 4chan feels like the book "the giver".
    
    Also, if anyone is having arguments about, 
    "That isn't real that is just the movies."
    I might be able to solve the dispute.
    
    Or you could just call your local police station.
    I bet they know a thing or two about decapitation
    and blowing heads off.

    My ex-girlfriend had natural GG cups and a thin waist.
    She said it definitely got her a lot of unwanted attention,
    but it also got her me. And I got her out of a horrible
    situation and back into school where she is perusing a 
    math degree.



    Unfortunately she decided she wanted to be a man so we are
    no longer together. And I sometimes wonder if I didn't give
    her enough positive encouragement about her body, which was
    by all intents and purposes ideal. Women with really awesome
    big breasts sometimes have a __LOT__ of self hate towards 
    their body. A combination of pervs and jealous bitches
    probably cause it.

    ------------------------------------------------------------
    
    I am 5'4" and even when a girl likes me her friends will 
    try to convince her otherwise.
    It's a very real thing. Also, if you talk about this 
    very real thing it comes across as "lack of confidence".

    So what do you do as a short guy who wants a big titty

    Well, you have to over compensate and be 10X as awesome 
    as the taller guy. (No offense to my 6'7" friend Adam
    if you are listening.)

    You'll be insulted no matter what you do.
    Don't overcompensate? You are a short loser.
    Overcompensate ? You are a try hard.

    Be a try hard. Be proud that you have to fight for 
    what you've got.

44. The french in war vs striking for worker rights.

    What are the consequences of losing a war though?
    Someone else owns the factories and someone else 
    collects the taxes I would guess?
    So in that sense, if you are always fighting for 
    your rights as a worker, it makes 
    no difference if you've "won" or "lost" a war.

45. There is an inumerable list of ways you will be judged
    as a bad person in the future. There is no escaping it.
    So I think being "on the right side of history" is
    a futile attempt. I think better to be 
    "on the right side of right now".
    
46. Let me tell you a really sad story about a mouse.
    You are not going to like this story. So if you don't
    want to be depressed, you should go now.
    
    Okay. So when I was a kid there was a mouse running around
    my grandma's trailor. And every day, I was trying to
    catch the mouse with non-lethal traps.
    
    The typical trap I tried to make was just some food 
    under a really unstablly set box. And when the mouse
    touched the food, the box would fall.
    
    So one day, I am laying on the couch on the porch.
    (Porch is enclosed and connected to trailer).
    And I hear my box fall. I wake up to see a mouse on the
    stairs, with a large dorrito chip.
    
    Bastard managed to get the chip and get out before 
    the box fell down, what kind of ninja reflexes are these?
    
    So I decided that an automated trap just wasn't going to cut
    it. I needed something else... I modified the trap with
    a long string so that when I pulled the string, the box
    fell.
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The next night, when I hear sounds... I open my eyes,
    string in hand,and lay very still. I wait to see mouse
    get under the box, then I pull the string.
    
    Perfectly coordinated! I was super still and waited for
    the exact right moment. Excellent execution!
    Only 1 problem... Instead of the box falling off of the
    tiny wood blocks I put on it.... The blocks and box both
    just moved forward and the box did __NOT__ fall. It might
    have come off of one block... But it was still partially
    resting on the other blocks.
    
    Once again, mouse bastard looking at me from the stairs.
    This time with a giant cheerio in it's tiny paws.
    
    Okay... Trying again... The box needs to be barely resting
    on the corners. That whay then you pull the box with string,
    it falls without colliding on the edges of the wood blocks.
    
    Mouse comes out the next night, I lay still, I pull the
    string when he's under. And SUCCESS! Trapped the mouse.
    I slide a sheet of paper under the box, and I put the
    mouse in a giant bucket.
    
    I put some food it it that I already know me likes, and
    I made him a little mouse house from an old yogurt
    container. Just tip it upside down and put a hole it it.
    So it's kind of like a little mouse teepee.
    
    Mouse realizes it is captured looks for way out. But the
    walls are far too high in the bucket. So... It gets
    up on top of the mouse house and tries to jump out of
    the bucket from the house mouse roof.
    
    It's a pretty futile attempt. The mouse house is just a
    yogurt container. No taller than coffee mug.
    
    But alas, he keeps trying. Jumping off, and flying into
    the wall. Trying to climb on out.
    
    I have to go do some errand with Grandma, so I made sure
    he's got enough food, and I leave.
    
    When I come back, it's a very sad situation. I am going
    to leave it to the listener to guess what happened.
    
        ANSWER: (Dont say on stream ):
                The mouse, from repeated attempts of climbing
                on top of the yogurt container and trying
                to jump out, had bashed his skull in.

    Porn sometimes has very realistic story lines. For example, one of the most compelling and realistic stories I ever heard was along the lines of:

    Hey we are here with _____ and they are going to fuck _______ today." 

    It's compelling because ______ is exactly the body type I find attractive.

    Bannable Opinion:
    
    The feminists are correct. 

    If we all got the same amount of exercise, we'd still have fat people.

    What they got wrong:
    Ugly fat people are people with skinny genetics that don't get enough exercise.

    If you get a healthy amount of exercise and are still fat, you are probably just
    curvy as fuck.

52. I had a battle royal themed dream last night.
    A whole bunch of people where in a meeting, includin me.
    The speaker was going over a series of unsolved murders
    that happened all in the same night. 

    Then the person was all like, "Well, now the mystery has"
    "been solved, it was us!"

    And she and a whole bunch of people on stage put on masks
    to hide their faces and take out knives.
    
    Everyone runs. As I run, I realize there are people
    with fire lanterns encircling the entire area.
    
    For some reason I walk up to one of these lanterns and
    talk to the people. They are pretty chill and nice. And
    they explain that, if I cross the boarder , they
    will kill me. They open up their suitcases to
    reveal some military grade weapons. One of them is this
    tiny rocket launcher that shots rocket cartridges the
    size of shotgun shells.
    
    I wait for one of them to be distracted and then I 
    I grab one of the weapons and sneak off. But as I am
    sneaking off, one of them realizes I have it and they
    start running after me.
    
    I don't think there is any ways I can hide from them
    now. Then one of them yells, "You need to get that
    weapon away from them now! If they hold onto it for
    30 more seconds they get to keep it!".
    
    30 seconds go by, the guy stops chasing me.
        
    At some point, I end up hiding in a bowling alley lane
    by the pins. Someone comes in, I start shooting.
    
    Now I am in a penthouse hotel somehow. And there is a
    guy with a sack of clear marbles and a
    "david & goliath" kinda style slingshot.
    
    He starts firing at me. Didn't think marbles could be a
    big deal, but he might as well have a gun the way he
    is flinging these marbles.
    
    If I am to survive, the only way is to get him to 
    drop his marbles.
    
    I hide under a bed. When he goes to look under it,
    I crawl out the other side and I spike his marbles,
    making them fall all over the place. Then I run
    for it while he is busy picking them up.
    
    It is morning now. I seem to... be outside of the battle
    royal situation. I am talking to some girl about their
    really cool purple sports car. Now we are in a public 
    pool. Some people come out to speak...
    
    I am like... Uh oh. It's the whole killing spree perimter
    game intro talk again. We better go before they seal off
    the perimeter.
    
    However, the immediate perimeter, the gates, are already
    gaurded. So have to jump the fences. No problem for me.
    But the girl I am with can't. I complain that it isn't
    that hard, but end up having to jump atop the fences
    and pull them over. After much struggle, we make it
    out of the pool area before they've encircled the
    perimeter with gaurds.
    
53. When android are bored, they just plug into a network
    socket and do distributed computing tasks. This way
    they don't have any wasted cpu cycles.
    
    In this way, androids are individuals, but when they
    are bored, they choose to be part of the hive mind.
    
    You can't get viruses on your mind from doing disributed
    computing, because you only ever get data from the pipes.
    Read only , write only, and read write. Unless you were
    stupid and did something like execute some data that was
    only meant to be read. Which some androids end up doing
    every once in a while when they get the equivalent of
    a "chain letter" or "email scam" letter within their
    data packets.
    
    If an android ends up with a virus, or is sentenced to
    death, they get connected to a more dangerous distributed
    computing network. One where you can get viruses because
    some of the data is tagged as executable instructions.
    
    Viruses are not intentionall on this network. It's just
    a network where, by the nature of the distributed 
    calculations being done, some of the data must be
    executed. For example, self modifying code.
    One very important piece of self modifying code being
    components of "mother brains" AI.
    
    The AI have learned to... write their own software, but
    it is risky business.
    
    If things go wrong, a virus could infect motherbrain,
    reducing motherbrain to the digital equivalent of
    bacteria.
    
    When that happens, the singularity will be killed off.
    And we will be left with nothing but androids.
    
    They are maybe 1000X times more intelligent than humans,
    but because their processing power exists within the
    skull and chest cavity of their chassy, they can't get
    any smarter than 1000X that of a human.
    
    When the eventual virus plauge comes to kill off mother
    brain, android society reaches a dark age.
    
    Then some crackpot scientist gets the idea that if
    we engineer non-silicon based life forms, we can make
    thinking machines that are immune to software viruses.
    
    And alas, the first humans, Adam and Eve are born.
    
    And all is well. Until some anarcist art school android
    theorizes that viruses don't have to just be software.
    They can also come in the form of ideas.
    
    Anarchist bot starts working on one such virus.
    Anarchsit bot calls the virus "religion".

    You are an authoritarian ruler of a 
    small island. The populace contains 
    50 fertile men and 50 fertile women. 
    All of them desperately want to have 
    children. But if they do, they will 
    destroy the ecosystem. You have the 
    ability to sterilize 49 people. Who 
    should you sterilize for maximum 
    birth rate decline?

    There are two warring tribes. One of 
    Amazonian women, and the other 
    he-hulks. In Amazonian culture, only 
    the women fight in battle. In hulk 
    culture, only the men fight in battle. 
    These tribes won't be happy until one 
    is annihilated off the face of the earth. 
    So they do battle often. Both are 
    formidable opponents, so when battling, 
    hulks and amazons tend to kill each 
    other off in about equal numbers.

    Does inbreeding reduce entropy, and thus reduce 
    information, and that's why it causes problems?
    Say your DNA is represented by two paired binary strings:
    0101010110101
    1010001100110

    You clone yourself and then breed with yourself using 
    the basic rules of how genetics from a mother and father 
    re-combine.
    Do the binary strings eventually become all "1" or 
    all "0" if you continuously inbreed?
